Greedy Method
-

- A problem can have many solutions. For ex, If you want to travel from place A to B, there can be many solutions.
- <b>Feasible solutions</b>
  - Out of all available solutions, those solutions which satisfy a constraint are called feasible solutions. 
  - For ex, reaching from source to destination in 12 hours.
- <b>Optimal solution</b>
  - This is used to solve optimization problem.
  - An optimization problem is a problem, which requires either min result or maximum result.
  - An optimal solution should be a feasible solution. Few eg of Optimization problems are find minimum time, minimum cost etc.
  - Optimization problems can be solved using the following strategies
    - <b>Greedy Method</b>
	- <b>Dynamic Programming</b>
	- <b>Branch and bound</b>
	
- Greedy method is also a strategy to solve a problem like <b>divide and conquer</b>
  - Greedy method sovles a problem in stages. 
    - In each stage one input is taken from given problem.
	- If the input is feasible we will include that in the solution.
	- Including all the feasible inputs, we will get the final solution.
  - Example of greedy method.
  - If you want to hire a candidate for the interview and the interview process includes written test,technical,group discussions etc.
