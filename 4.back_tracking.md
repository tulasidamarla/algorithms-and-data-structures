Brute Force approach
--------------------
- Finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution as per the problem statement.

Backtracking
------------
- Backtracking is a problem solving strategy.
- This strategy uses brute force approach.
- This strategy is followed in Dynamic programming, but in dynamic programming we find optimum solution whereas backtracking used to find all possible solutions.
- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.
- The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function.
- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
- Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach similar to Backtracking, but uses Breadth-First Search method.

<b>Consider the below problem</b>

There are 3 students in a class 2 boys and a girl. There are 3 chairs. Find all possible arrangements for 3 students.

Solution: As we know the answer of arranging n students is n!, so in this case there should be 3! solutions i.e. 6.

		      Root
		  /     |     \   
		 B1      B2     G1    
		/ \     / \     / \   
	       B2  G1   B1  G1  B1  B2 
	       |    |   |   |    |   |  
	       G1   B2  G1  B1   B2  B1

The above solution is brute force because it finds all solutions.

Now lets consider another problem to find all possible solutions inwhich girl should not be in the middle, then backtracking improvizes on brute-force.

		      Root
		  /     |     \   
		 B1     B2     G1    
		/       |      / \   
	       B2      B1     B1   B2 
	       |        |      |   |  
	       G1      G1     B2   B1
