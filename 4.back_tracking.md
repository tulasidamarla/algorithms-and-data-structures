Brute Force approach
--------------------
- Finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution as per the problem statement.

Backtracking
------------
- Backtracking is a problem solving strategy.
- This strategy uses brute force approach.
- This strategy is followed in Dynamic programming, but in dynamic programming we find optimum solution whereas backtracking used to find all possible solutions.
- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.
- The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function.
- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
- Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach similar to Backtracking, but uses Breadth-First Search method.

Problem to understand Backtracking
----------------------------------
There are 3 students in a class 2 boys and a girl. There are 3 chairs. Find all possible arrangements for 3 students.

Solution: As we know the answer of arranging n students is n!, so in this case there should be 3! solutions i.e. 6.
