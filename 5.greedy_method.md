Greedy Method
-

- Like Greedy method is also a strategy to solve a problem like <b>divide and conquer</b>
- A problem can have many solutions. For ex, If you want to travel from place A to B, there can be many solutions.
- <b>Feasible solutions</b>
  - Out of all available solutions, those solutions which satisfy a constraint are called feasible solutions. 
  - For ex, reaching from source to destination in 12 hours.
- <b>Optimal solution</b>
  - This is used to solve optimization problem.
  - An optimization problem is a problem, which requires either min result or maximum result.
  - An optimal solution should be a feasible. Few eg of Optimization problems are find minimum time, minimum cost etc.
