### Spanning tree

- Spanning tree is a tree formed out of a graph with n-1 edges where nis no of vertices.

- The above spanning tree is derived from a weighted graph. A graph with weighted
  edges is called weighted graph.

### Minimum cost spanning tree

- A spanning tree with minimum weight is called minimum cost spanning tree.
- There are two greedy algorithms to find minimum cost spanning tree.
  - Prim's
  - Kruskals
