### Optimization problem

- For a given problem there can be more than one solution.
- All solutions meet the constraints given in the problem are called feasible solutions.
  - For a given problem there can be more than one feasible solution.
- A feasible solution which gives either minimum or maximum result is called optimal solution.
  - For a given problem there can only be one optimal solution.
- A problem which requires either minimum or maximum result is called Optimization problem.
