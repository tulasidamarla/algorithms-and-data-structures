Time complexity Analysis
------------------------
There are two types of algorithms. They are iterative and recursive. Any function that is written using iterative algorithm can be written using recursive algorithm and vice versa. There is nothing like one is better than other. 

Time complexity for iterative functions is determined by the no of times an iteration is executed. Incase of recursive algorithm time complexity is calculated by recursive functions. If an algorithm has neither iteration nor recursive, time complexity such an algorithm is not dependent on input size n. It is constant.
